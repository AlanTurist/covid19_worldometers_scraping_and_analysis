  <center>Web scraper worldosmeters_scraper.py takes all the data from worldometers.info and creates the today_worldwide_covid19_data.csv data base for all the countries daily. And after that, covid19_analysis_2.1.py analyzes all the data.
    The script is available in two laguages, Greek and English. Just type 'Gr' for Greek or 'EN' for English.
    </center>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you like to test the script, just download covid19_analysis_2.1.exe and run it.
    <br>
    <br>
    The today_worldwide_covid19_data.csv is updated every day after ~ 19:00.
    <br>
    <br>
    The differences with the old_version are, now you can chech statistics for every country or area from the 224 on the .csv file
    <br>
    and you have to download the .exe only once as opposed to the old version you had to download it every day!
