  <center>Web scraper worldosmeters_scraper.py takes all the data from worldometers.info and creates the today_worldwide_covid19_data.csv data       base for all the countries daily. And after that, covid19_analysis_2.0.py analyzes all the data.</center>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you like to test the script, just download covid19_analysis_2.0.exe and run it. (Translation will be insert soon.. For now it's only in Greek )
    <br>
    <br>
    The today_worldwide_covid19_data.csv is updated every day after ~ 19:00.
    <br>
    The differences with the old_version are, now you can chech statistics for every country or area from the 224 of the .csv file
    <br>
    and you have to download the .exe only once as opposed to the old version you had to download it every day!
