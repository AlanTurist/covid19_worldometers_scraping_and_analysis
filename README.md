    <center>The web scraper <i>worldosmeters_scraper.exe</i> takes all the data from worldometers.info and creates the <i>today_worldwide_covid19_data.csv</i> data base for all the countries daily. And after that, <i>covid19_analysis_2.1.py</i> analyzes all the data.
    The script is available in two laguages, Greek and English. Just type 'GR' for Greek or 'EN' for English.
    </center>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you like to test the script, just download <i>covid19_analysis_2.1.exe</i> and run it.
    <br>
    <br>
    The <i>today_worldwide_covid19_data.csv</i> is updated daily.
    <br>
    <br>
    The differences with the old_version are, now you can chech statistics for every country or area from the 224 on the .csv file
    <br>
    and you have to download the .exe only once as opposed to the old version you had to download it every day!
